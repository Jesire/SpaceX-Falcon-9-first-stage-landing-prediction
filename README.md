# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-landing-prediction

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, which is significantly lower than other providers whose costs exceed $165 million. This is primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by predicting the successful landing of the first stage, one can estimate the cost of a launch. This knowledge could be beneficial for a company seeking to compete with SpaceX in the bidding process for a rocket launch contract.
